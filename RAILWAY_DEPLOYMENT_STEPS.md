# ðŸš€ Complete Railway Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Railway account (free at [railway.app](https://railway.app))
- Your API keys ready

## Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

## Step 2: Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
```
This will open your browser to authenticate.

## Step 3: Deploy Backend

### 3.1 Navigate to server directory
```bash
cd server
```

### 3.2 Initialize Railway project
```bash
railway init --name trilion-backend
```

### 3.3 Deploy backend
```bash
railway up
```

### 3.4 Get backend URL
```bash
railway domain
```
Note this URL - you'll need it for the frontend.

### 3.5 Set backend environment variables
```bash
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
railway variables set YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID=your_youtube_client_id_here
railway variables set YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_youtube_client_secret_here
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

## Step 4: Deploy Frontend

### 4.1 Navigate to frontend directory
```bash
cd ../video-clipper
```

### 4.2 Initialize Railway project
```bash
railway init --name trilion-frontend
```

### 4.3 Deploy frontend
```bash
railway up
```

### 4.4 Get frontend URL
```bash
railway domain
```

### 4.5 Set frontend environment variables
```bash
railway variables set REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
```

## Step 5: Update Backend CORS

### 5.1 Go back to backend directory
```bash
cd ../server
```

### 5.2 Set CORS origin to your frontend URL
```bash
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-url.railway.app
```

## Step 6: Test Your Deployment

### 6.1 Test backend
Visit your backend URL: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/`
Should show: `{"message":"Server is running!","status":"active",...}`

### 6.2 Test frontend
Visit your frontend URL: `https://your-frontend-url.railway.app/`
Should load your React app

### 6.3 Test integration
Try generating clips from the frontend

## Troubleshooting

### If backend fails to deploy:
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify environment variables: `railway variables`
3. Check Python dependencies in logs

### If frontend fails to deploy:
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify build process
3. Check environment variables

### If CORS errors:
1. Verify CORS_ORIGIN is set correctly
2. Check that frontend URL matches exactly

## Useful Commands

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Redeploy
railway up

# Open in browser
railway open

# Check status
railway status
```

## Expected URLs
- Backend: `https://trilion-backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`
- Frontend: `https://trilion-frontend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

## Success Indicators
âœ… Backend responds with server status  
âœ… Frontend loads without errors  
âœ… Can generate clips from frontend  
âœ… No CORS errors in browser console  

Your app is now live on Railway! ðŸŽ‰
