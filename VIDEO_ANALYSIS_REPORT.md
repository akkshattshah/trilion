> "First glance, this might look like a shaky system that runs just on pinky promises and trusts amongst each other. But essentially, this is what makes development possible. If a country would have to physically transfer actual cash for every single transaction that happens in the global economy, the system would be incredibly slow and inefficient. Instead, countries and institutions make agreements and promises to pay each other back later. This creates a web of interconnected financial relationships that allows for rapid economic growth and development on a global scale."
